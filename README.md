# DataAnalytics4_Project
1) Masters program coursework for Data Analytics 4 module.

2) Topic assigned: Yolo

3) Use case is to present new images to pre-trained Yolo v3 model. Capture the inference (class names and confidence score) for all image, and then put into a Neo4j database. Using Neo4j Desktop v1.2.8.

4) Anaconda environment setup notes. Below are the commands entered manually in the order specified.
Create Python 3.7 environment (e.g. conda create -n ce2da41 python=3.7),
conda install jupyter,
pip install neo4j,
conda instlall pytz,
conda install keras,
-- Refer environment.yml file for output of command: conda env export > environment.yml

6) Script: my_yolo3_one_file_to_detect_them_all_6.py
Action: Uses pre-trained Yolo v3 model for inference on images. The inference data is stored in a Neo4j database in the form of (:Image)-[:HAS]->(:Object). User provides a folder which contains all the images to process. Note: some images cannot be processed due to resizing issues and will be skipped.
