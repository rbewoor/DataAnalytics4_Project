Script: my_yolo3_one_file_to_detect_them_all_6.py
Action: Uses pre-trained Yolo v3 model for inference on images. The inference data is stored in a Neo4j database in the form of (:Image)-[:HAS]->(:Object). User provides a folder which contains all the images to process. Note: some images cannot be processed due to resizing issues and will be skipped.
